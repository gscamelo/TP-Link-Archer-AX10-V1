# TP-Link-Archer-AX10-V1
A proof of concept for TP-LINK router Archer AX10 v1

## Intro
The device I conducted this research on was the Archer AX10 v1 home WiFi router from TP-Link (Firmware Version 1.3.1 Build 20220401 Rel. 57450(5553)).

My first approach was to get access via the UART Interface on the board.
